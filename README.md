# odin-giphy-api

This is a task to practice working with the giphy api, specifically, its translate endpoint ([docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate)), which enables words and phrases to be converted to a gif.

This is part of The Odin Project's ["Working with APIs"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis) lesson, as part of its "Full Stack JavaScript" course
